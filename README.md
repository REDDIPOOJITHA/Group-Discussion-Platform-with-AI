 ## Group Discussion Platform with AI (Gemini API)

This is a Flask-based web application that simulates a group discussion between users and AI bots. Users participate via voice input, and AI bots (powered by Gemini API) provide alternating supportive and opposing viewpoints based on the selected discussion topic.

Speech recognition and text-to-speech are handled via the Web Speech API to offer a fully interactive speaking/listening experience.
